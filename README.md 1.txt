## 6. Business Implications
The companyâ€™s heavy reliance on a limited set of customers, product categories, and top-performing sales reps creates a potential vulnerability. While the strong performance of certain regions and products drives short-term gains, the lack of balance limits growth opportunities and poses long-term sustainability risks.

4. **Strengthen Weak Regions** â€” Adapt the strategies used in high-performing regions to improve results in areas with lower sales.
